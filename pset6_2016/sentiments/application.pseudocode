Complete the implementation of search in application.py in such a way that the function

queries Twitter’s API for a user’s most recent 100 tweets,
classifies each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral,
generates a chart that accurately depicts those sentiments as percentages.
If a user has tweeted fewer than 100 times, classify as many tweets as exist.
